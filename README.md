Musical-Power-Glove
===================

A Processing/Arduino script using Minim to turn movement from a hand into a music instrument. Reads input from fingers via force-flex sensors, and grabs the difference based on the average output. It turns this value then into musical notes. Code can be modified to play songs rather than notes for each finger.
